**Summary**

Augmented Reality is quite trending in mobile application development, it is a feature which is enhancing user experience and involvement. What I have seen, newspaper reading is not as popular anymore as it was, so through my application, I tried to find a new way to make people enjoy newspaper reading, using currently trending technology Augmented Reality.  Magical News Paper application will be for it, it will update the user's real-world view of newspaper with dynamic videos over static images, using a cellphone camera. The original thought is to implement this application using Smart Glasses since they are expensive and not available to everyone, my application will be going to use the mobile camera to achieve the same. The concept for this is futuristic, where it depends on the resources which are not available right now like REST APIs for required news data (Linked videos and images) or not in everyone reach like Smart Glasses.
